These missions are available for all italki users. In the #LanguageHacking community, you can watch other people's videos, upload your own videos, and get encouragement from the community. #LanguageHacking is available for learners of French, Italian, German and Spanish.<br><strong>Challenge yourself to speak today!</strong>",

It's a new way of thinking about language learning and how people communicate today.<br>Language \"hacks\" are shortcuts you can use to get fluent faster.<br>Language hacking gets you speaking right from day one! You'll be having real conversations with real people.<br>You don't need a super memory. And it's definitely not about having perfect grammar. You just need to be willing to give new things a try.<br>It may be a bit unconventional… but it's not magic. It's just a smarter way to learn languages.<br><strong>Anyone can do it. Are you in?</strong>",
  "LH215":"About Benny",
  "LH216":"Benny Lewis used to be just like most of us—fluent in just one language, but with a nagging desire to learn more. After university, he moved to Spain to try and pick up Spanish but found himself no more fluent after six months than he'd been when he arrived. Frustrated, he decided to put his background in electrical engineering to good use by developing a method that broke down language learning into universal milestones, focusing on acquisition through regular conversation. And this is where Language Hacking began!<br>Today, Benny is known throughout the language learning community as \"the Irish Polyglot\" and is famous for his many online videos that document his language learning adventures around the world. He runs the internet's biggest language learning blog, <a href=\"http://www.fluentin3months.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.fluentin3months.com</a>, and is the author of the bestselling book by the same name.",
